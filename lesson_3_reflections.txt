When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When there are other people working on the project with me.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone else might be working on a particular branch and pushing commits in it. I may now 
also, want to switch to that branch, so now I need to pull changes on that branch manually.
I may also be working independently on that same branch but may now have decided that my team mate's
approach is better. So, he may push things and I can then pull the changes.
