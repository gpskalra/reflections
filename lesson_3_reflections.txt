When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When there are other people working on the project with me.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone else might be working on a particular branch and pushing commits in it. I may now 
also, want to switch to that branch, so now I need to pull changes on that branch manually.
I may also be working independently on that same branch but may now have decided that my team mate's
approach is better. So, he may push things and I can then pull the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork: Make a copy from someone's Github account to yours.
clone: Make a copy at your local computer. The source can be local or remote.
Branch: Make a new branch. Operates on a repository.

Fork: Start a new project, from where someone left off.
Clone: Collaborate to an existing project.
Branch: Try a new feature experimentally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

As we saw, git pull can now sync all the changes by first doing a fetch and then merge. If 
no access to the local copy was there, this would not be possible.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

By mailing changes everytime, keeping a master folder and making changes to it when all agree to the 
change. Easier: No commands to run. Harder:Pretty much everything else, viewing changes, getting confused
which folder to see.
