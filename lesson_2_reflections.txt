What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialising a repository tells git that it needs to track the directory contents.
Git now creates the meta-data and gets to work from now on.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a selection of files and not a directory or a whole record of directory.
Git needs to save changes made between different commits. Staging area allows one to 
save space by saving only a few files rather than all.
